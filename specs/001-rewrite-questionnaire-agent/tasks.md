# Tasks: Rewrite Questionnaire Agent using Microsoft Agent Framework

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-rewrite-questionnaire-agent/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are OPTIONAL based on constitutional requirement for TDD. Mock modes are included for testing without Azure dependencies.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
Based on plan.md structure - single desktop application with modular architecture at repository root

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [X] T001 Create project directory structure per implementation plan with ui/, excel/, agents/, utils/, tests/ modules
- [X] T002 Initialize Python 3.11+ project with .venv virtual environment and requirements.txt
- [X] T003 [P] Create .env.template file with required Azure AI Foundry configuration variables
- [X] T004 [P] Setup .gitignore to exclude .env files and Python cache directories

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Multi-Agent Workflow Orchestration (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: System orchestrates three specialized agents with distinct responsibilities, continuing until approval or maximum retries reached, with visible reasoning

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed) or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May reuse Agent orchestration from US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Enhances agents from US1/US2 but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (TDD requirement) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Agent executors before workflow orchestration
- UI components before integration
- Core implementation before error handling and progress tracking
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks can run in parallel within Phase 1
- Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within Phase 2
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Within each user story, tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (TDD requirement):
Task T014: "Unit test for Question data validation"
Task T015: "Unit test for UIManager.process_single_question"
Task T016: "Integration test for single question workflow"
Task T017: "Mock mode test for GUI question processing"

# Launch all agent executors for User Story 1 together:
Task T019: "Create Question Answerer agent executor"
Task T020: "Create Answer Checker agent executor" 
Task T021: "Create Link Checker agent executor"

# Launch all UI components for User Story 1 together:
Task T023: "Create main GUI window layout"
Task T024: "Implement status bar and progress tracking"
Task T025: "Create error dialog system"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently with single question processing
5. Deploy/demo if ready - users can process individual questions with multi-agent validation

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Excel capability added)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Enhanced orchestration)
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Single Question Processing)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Excel Batch Processing)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Multi-Agent Orchestration)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Constitutional requirement: Tests written first (TDD) with mock modes for Azure-free testing
- Verify tests fail before implementing to ensure proper test coverage
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Microsoft Agent Framework --pre flag required for installation
- FoundryAgentSession pattern mandatory for Azure resource cleanup

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality checks passed

**Validation Date**: October 23, 2025

**Key Improvements Made**:

1. Expanded from single-sheet to comprehensive multi-sheet processing
2. Added 4 additional user stories covering sheet navigation, status indicators, and user control
3. Added 9 new functional requirements for multi-sheet handling
4. Enhanced key entities to include WorkbookView, SheetTab, and navigation state tracking
5. Expanded success criteria with 4 new measurable outcomes for multi-sheet scenarios
6. Updated assumptions to reflect Python/tkinter UI framework and typical Excel file characteristics

## Notes

✅ Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`

The specification now comprehensively covers:

- Multi-sheet Excel file processing with sequential sheet handling
- Auto-navigation to active processing sheet with user override capability
- Visual indicators (spinner icons) on sheet tabs
- Real-time cell status updates (pink for working, light green for completed)
- Deferred save behavior (only saves after all sheets complete)
- Edge cases for complex scenarios (hidden sheets, varied sheet sizes, special characters)

# Feature Specification: User Feedback and Re-processing

**Feature Branch**: `003-user-feedback-and`  
**Created**: October 27, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "User feedback and re-processing feature that allows users to provide feedback on answers and trigger re-processing with agent workflow in both single-question and spreadsheet modes"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-27

*   Q: What happens when feedback is submitted while the system is already processing another question? → A: Another set of agents should be spawned and should begin re-answering that question.
*   Q: How should the system handle very long feedback text that exceeds reasonable limits? → A: Enforce a hard character limit (2000 chars) and truncate with warning
*   Q: What occurs if the re-processing fails or times out after feedback submission? → A: Automatically retry re-processing up to 3 times before failing
*   Q: How does the system behave when a user provides feedback on a cell that's already being processed? → A: Block feedback submission with message "Cell currently processing" - the ... button should not even render while processing
*   Q: What happens if the user closes the application while feedback-triggered re-processing is in progress? → A: Just silently quit, do nothing differently

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Single-Question Feedback (Priority: P1)

A user working in single-question mode receives an answer but wants to provide feedback to improve its accuracy. They can click a feedback button, provide comments, and have the system re-process the question with their feedback incorporated.

**Why this priority**: This is the core feedback functionality and represents the minimum viable product. Single-question mode is simpler to implement and test, making it the logical foundation for the feature.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by asking a question in single-question mode, receiving an answer, clicking the feedback button, submitting feedback, and verifying the re-processing occurs with improved context.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a user has received an answer in single-question mode, **When** they click the feedback button ("..." button at bottom right of Answer edit box), **Then** a feedback overlay appears with a text area and Submit/Cancel buttons
2.  **Given** the feedback overlay is open, **When** the user enters feedback text and clicks Submit, **Then** the system triggers re-processing with the Question Answerer, Answer Checker, and Link Checker agents using the user's feedback as additional context
3.  **Given** the feedback overlay is open, **When** the user clicks Cancel, **Then** the overlay closes without triggering re-processing
4.  **Given** re-processing has been triggered, **When** the agents complete their work, **Then** the updated answer appears in the Answer edit box

### User Story 2 - Spreadsheet Mode Feedback (Priority: P2)

A user working in spreadsheet mode wants to provide feedback on an already-answered cell to improve the quality of the response. They can click a feedback button on the cell, provide comments, and have the system re-process that specific question.

**Why this priority**: This extends the core feedback functionality to spreadsheet mode, which is more complex due to the multi-cell interface but provides significant value for bulk processing workflows.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by processing a spreadsheet with multiple questions, clicking the feedback button on an answered cell, submitting feedback, and verifying that specific cell gets re-processed while others remain unchanged.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a spreadsheet cell has been answered and shows completed status, **When** the user clicks the feedback button ("..." button at right edge of the cell), **Then** a feedback overlay appears positioned over the cell with a text area and Submit/Cancel buttons
2.  **Given** the feedback overlay is open for a spreadsheet cell, **When** the user enters feedback text and clicks Submit, **Then** the cell status changes to "Processing" and turns pink, and re-processing begins with the user's feedback as additional context
3.  **Given** a cell is being re-processed due to feedback, **When** the agents complete their work, **Then** the cell shows the updated answer and returns to completed status
4.  **Given** multiple cells have been processed, **When** feedback is provided on one cell, **Then** only that specific cell is re-processed while others remain unchanged

### User Story 3 - Feedback History and Context (Priority: P3)

Users want to track what feedback they've provided and understand how it influenced the re-processing results. The system maintains a record of feedback iterations for each question.

**Why this priority**: This enhances the user experience by providing transparency and learning opportunities, but is not essential for the core feedback functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by providing feedback multiple times on the same question and verifying that the system maintains a history of feedback and shows how each iteration influenced the results.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a user has provided feedback on a question multiple times, **When** they view the question details, **Then** they can see a history of feedback iterations and resulting answers
2.  **Given** agents are re-processing with user feedback, **When** the new answer is generated, **Then** the system indicates how the feedback influenced the result

---

### Edge Cases

*   When feedback is submitted while the system is already processing another question, the system spawns a new set of agents (Question Answerer, Answer Checker, Link Checker) to begin re-answering the feedback question concurrently
*   The system enforces a 2000-character limit on feedback text and truncates longer input with a warning message to the user
*   If re-processing fails or times out after feedback submission, the system automatically retries up to 3 times before showing an error and reverting to the original answer
*   When a cell is already being processed, the feedback button ("..." button) does not render and feedback submission is blocked with message "Cell currently processing"
*   If the user closes the application while feedback-triggered re-processing is in progress, the application silently quits without special handling - processing is cancelled and original answer remains

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

*   **FR-001**: System MUST display a feedback button ("..." button) at the bottom right of the Answer edit box in single-question mode when an answer has been provided
*   **FR-002**: System MUST display a feedback button ("..." button) at the right edge of spreadsheet cells that have been answered
*   **FR-003**: System MUST show a feedback overlay with text area and Submit/Cancel buttons when the feedback button is clicked
*   **FR-004**: System MUST pass user feedback as additional context to the Question Answerer and Answer Checker agents during re-processing
*   **FR-005**: System MUST trigger the complete agent workflow (Question Answerer → Answer Checker → Link Checker) when feedback is submitted
*   **FR-006**: System MUST change spreadsheet cell status to "Processing" and turn the cell pink when feedback-triggered re-processing begins
*   **FR-007**: System MUST update the answer display with the new result when feedback-triggered re-processing completes
*   **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to cancel feedback submission without triggering re-processing
*   **FR-009**: System MUST position the feedback overlay appropriately for both single-question and spreadsheet modes
*   **FR-010**: System MUST prevent multiple simultaneous feedback operations on the same question or cell
*   **FR-011**: System MUST handle feedback text input with reasonable length limits and validation
*   **FR-012**: System MUST provide visual indication when feedback-triggered re-processing is in progress
*   **FR-013**: System MUST support concurrent processing by spawning new agent sets when feedback is submitted while other questions are being processed
*   **FR-014**: System MUST enforce a 2000-character limit on feedback text and truncate longer input with a warning message

*   **FR-016**: System MUST hide the feedback button and block feedback submission when a cell is currently being processed, displaying "Cell currently processing" message if user attempts interaction

### Key Entities

*   **Feedback**: User-provided comments or suggestions for improving an answer, including timestamp and associated question context
*   **Processing Session**: A workflow execution triggered by user feedback, linking the original question, user feedback, and resulting improved answer
*   **Cell State**: Status tracking for spreadsheet cells including completed, processing, and feedback-triggered processing states

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

*   **SC-001**: Users can successfully submit feedback and receive updated answers in under 3 minutes for single questions
*   **SC-002**: Feedback-triggered re-processing produces different answers than the original in at least 70% of cases where meaningful feedback is provided
*   **SC-003**: Users can provide feedback on any answered cell in spreadsheet mode without affecting other cells' processing status
*   **SC-004**: System handles feedback submission and re-processing for spreadsheets with up to 100 answered cells without performance degradation
*   **SC-005**: 95% of feedback submissions successfully trigger re-processing without system errors or timeouts
*   **SC-006**: Users can complete the feedback submission process (from clicking feedback button to submitting) in under 1 minute
*   **SC-007**: Visual status indicators accurately reflect processing state changes in real-time for both single-question and spreadsheet modes

## Assumptions

*   Users will provide meaningful feedback that can improve answer quality
*   The existing agent workflow (Question Answerer → Answer Checker → Link Checker) can effectively utilize user feedback as additional context
*   Feedback text will typically be under 2000 characters for most use cases
*   Re-processing with feedback should follow the same timeout and error handling patterns as initial processing
*   Users understand that feedback triggers re-processing which may take time to complete
*   The UI framework supports overlay positioning and dynamic status updates for both modes
*   Application closure during feedback processing does not require special handling or user warnings

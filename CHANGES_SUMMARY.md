# Summary of Changes: Plain Text Formatting Enforcement

## Issue
The Question Answerer was emitting answers with markdown formatting (bold text, bullet points, headers, etc.), but plain text output was desired instead.

## Solution
Modified both the Question Answerer and Answer Checker agents to enforce plain text formatting in all generated answers.

## Files Changed

### 1. `src/agents/question_answerer.py`

#### Agent Instructions
Added a new **FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS** section to the agent instructions:
- Write in PLAIN TEXT ONLY - no markdown, no bold, no italics, no headers
- Do NOT use `**bold**`, `*italics*`, `` `code blocks` ``, or `# headers`
- Do NOT use bullet points (`-`), numbered lists (`1. 2. 3.`), or any special formatting
- Write in complete sentences as natural prose paragraphs
- Answer must end with a period and contain only complete sentences
- Do NOT include closing phrases like "Learn more:", "References:", "For more information, see:", etc.
- Put documentation URLs at the end, separated by newlines with no other text

#### Question Prompt
Added an **IMPORTANT - FORMATTING** section to each question prompt:
- Write ONLY in plain text with NO markdown formatting
- NO `**bold**`, `*italics*`, `` `code` ``, `# headers`, bullet points, or numbered lists
- Write as natural prose in complete sentences
- End answer with a period
- Place documentation URLs at the end, separated by newlines

### 2. `src/agents/answer_checker.py`

#### Agent Instructions
Added **FORMATTING VALIDATION** criteria:
- REJECT if answer contains `**bold**`, `*italics*`, `` `code blocks` ``, or `# headers`
- REJECT if answer uses bullet points (`-`), numbered lists (`1. 2. 3.`), or special markdown
- REJECT if answer has closing phrases like "Learn more:", "References:", "For more information:", etc.
- APPROVE only if answer is written in natural prose with complete sentences
- Answer should end with a period (after prose, before any URLs)

#### Validation Prompt
Added a **FORMATTING CHECK** section to validation prompts:
- Verify answer has NO `**bold**`, `*italics*`, `` `code` ``, `# headers`
- Verify answer has NO bullet points (`-`), numbered lists (`1. 2. 3.`)
- Verify answer has NO closing phrases like "Learn more:", "References:", etc.
- Verify answer is written as natural prose in complete sentences
- REJECT if any markdown or special formatting is present

### 3. `tests/unit/test_plain_text_formatting.py` (NEW)
Created unit tests to verify that:
- Question Answerer instructions require plain text output
- Answer Checker instructions validate plain text format
- Question prompts include plain text formatting requirements
- Validation prompts check for plain text format
- Common markdown patterns are mentioned in both agent prompts

### 4. `docs/PLAIN_TEXT_FORMATTING.md` (NEW)
Created comprehensive documentation explaining:
- The plain text formatting requirements
- Examples of before/after formatting
- Validation criteria for the Answer Checker
- Implementation details
- Benefits of plain text formatting

## Example Output Comparison

### Before (with markdown formatting)
```
**Key Features:**
- **Custom Neural Voices:** Select from over 400 voices
- **Real-time & Batch Conversion:** Generate speech instantly

### After (plain text only)
```
Yes, Microsoft Azure AI provides robust Text to Speech (TTS) capabilities through the Azure Speech service. Azure Text to Speech allows you to convert text input into natural human-like speech using neural voices, supporting multiple languages and voice styles. Key features include custom neural voices with selection from over 400 voices in 140+ languages and variants, real-time and batch conversion to generate speech instantly from text or process large volumes of text using batch synthesis, voice customization to personalize voice output with Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) to adjust pitch, rate, pauses, and emphasis, and security and compliance to ensure data privacy and compliance with enterprise standards.

## Impact

### Minimal Changes
- Only modified the agent instructions and prompts
- No changes to the agent execution logic or workflow
- No changes to the data structures or API interfaces
- Backward compatible - existing functionality remains intact

### Benefits
1. **Consistency** - All answers follow the same clean format
2. **Readability** - Plain text is easier to read and process
3. **Compatibility** - Works better with Excel, CSV, and other text formats
4. **Professional** - Clean, professional appearance without visual clutter
5. **Validation** - Automated checking ensures compliance

## Testing
- Created unit tests to verify formatting requirements are present in prompts
- Validated Python syntax (no errors)
- Changes align with the old implementation in `question_answerer_old.py`

## Notes
- The old `question_answerer_old.py` file already had similar "Write in plain text without formatting" instructions
- This change brings the new agent implementation in line with the original behavior
- URLs are still included at the end of answers for reference
- Answers remain comprehensive and informative, just without markdown formatting

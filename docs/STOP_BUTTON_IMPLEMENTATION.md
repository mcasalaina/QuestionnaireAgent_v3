# Stop Button Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds a Stop button during spreadsheet processing that allows users to cancel the current operation immediately. When processing a spreadsheet, the UI enters a special "spreadsheet mode" that:
- Clears and disables the Question box
- Disables (but keeps visible) the Max Retries and Character Limit boxes
- Hides the Documentation tab
- Changes the Ask button to a Stop button
- Disables the Import from Excel button

## Changes Made

### 1. UI Manager (src/ui/main_window.py)

#### New Instance Variables
- `char_limit_entry`: Reference to Character Limit entry widget
- `max_retries_entry`: Reference to Maximum Retries entry widget
- `docs_frame`: Reference to Documentation tab frame
- `current_excel_processor`: Reference to active ExcelProcessor for cancellation

#### Modified Methods

**`_create_left_panel()`**
- Now stores references to `char_limit_entry` and `max_retries_entry` widgets

**`_create_right_panel()`**
- Stores reference to `docs_frame` for the Documentation tab

**`_set_processing_state(processing: bool, is_spreadsheet: bool = False)`**
- Enhanced to accept `is_spreadsheet` parameter
- When `processing=True` and `is_spreadsheet=True`:
  - Clears and disables question entry (with gray background)
  - Disables char limit and max retries entries
  - Hides Documentation tab
  - Changes Ask button to Stop button
  - Disables Import button
- When `processing=False`:
  - Re-enables all UI elements
  - Shows Documentation tab
  - Restores Ask button

#### New Methods

**`_hide_documentation_tab()`**
- Hides the Documentation tab from the notebook during spreadsheet processing

**`_show_documentation_tab()`**
- Shows the Documentation tab after processing completes

**`_on_stop_clicked()`**
- Handles Stop button click
- Calls `cancel_processing()` on the current ExcelProcessor
- Updates status to "Cancelling processing..."

**`_process_excel_agents()`**
- Modified to store processor reference in `current_excel_processor`
- Clears reference in finally block after processing completes

#### Updated Call Sites
- `_on_import_excel_clicked()`: Now calls `_set_processing_state(True, is_spreadsheet=True)`
- `_auto_start_spreadsheet()`: Now calls `_set_processing_state(True, is_spreadsheet=True)`

### 2. Excel Processor (src/excel/processor.py)

The `cancel_processing()` method already existed and sets the `cancelled` flag. The processor checks this flag during processing and stops immediately when it's set to `True`.

## Testing

### Automated Tests

Run the integration tests from the project root:
```bash
python3 tests/unit/test_stop_button.py
```

The tests verify:
- ✓ ExcelProcessor has cancel_processing() method
- ✓ UIManager has _on_stop_clicked() method
- ✓ UIManager._set_processing_state() accepts is_spreadsheet parameter
- ✓ UIManager has hide/show Documentation tab methods
- ✓ UIManager stores current_excel_processor reference
- ✓ Excel processing calls use is_spreadsheet=True

### Manual Testing (requires GUI environment)

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   python3 run_app.py
   ```

2. **Import an Excel file:**
   - Click "Import From Excel"
   - Select a test spreadsheet with multiple questions

3. **Verify UI changes during processing:**
   - [ ] Question box is cleared and grayed out
   - [ ] Max Retries box is disabled (but value still visible)
   - [ ] Character Limit box is disabled (but value still visible)
   - [ ] Documentation tab is hidden
   - [ ] Ask button changes to "Stop" button
   - [ ] Import from Excel button is disabled

4. **Test Stop button:**
   - Click the "Stop" button during processing
   - Verify processing stops immediately
   - Verify status shows "Cancelling processing..."

5. **Verify UI restoration after stopping:**
   - [ ] Question box is re-enabled and white
   - [ ] Max Retries box is re-enabled
   - [ ] Character Limit box is re-enabled
   - [ ] Documentation tab is visible again
   - [ ] Stop button changes back to "Ask!" button
   - [ ] Import from Excel button is re-enabled

6. **Test completion without stopping:**
   - Import another Excel file
   - Let it complete processing without stopping
   - Verify all UI elements are properly restored

## Code Flow

```
User clicks "Import From Excel"
    ↓
_on_import_excel_clicked()
    ↓
_load_and_display_excel_sync() - loads file and shows workbook view
    ↓
_set_processing_state(True, is_spreadsheet=True) - enters spreadsheet mode
    ↓
_start_async_excel_processing()
    ↓
_process_excel_agents()
    ↓
Creates ExcelProcessor, stores reference in current_excel_processor
    ↓
processor.process_workbook() - processes all questions
    ↓
[User clicks Stop button] → _on_stop_clicked() → processor.cancel_processing()
    ↓
Processing completes (normally or cancelled)
    ↓
_handle_excel_result()
    ↓
_set_processing_state(False) - restores normal UI state
```

## Known Limitations

1. The Stop button cancels processing immediately, but:
   - The current question being processed may complete before stopping
   - Partially processed results (i.e., completed questions within the batch) are visible in the workbook view but are not automatically saved to a file unless the user chooses to save when prompted
   - The workbook view shows all questions that were completed before stopping

2. The UI restoration happens when processing completes, not immediately when Stop is clicked. This is because:
   - We need to wait for the async processing to actually stop
   - The processor checks the cancelled flag at safe points in the processing loop

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be made:
1. Add a confirmation dialog before cancelling if significant progress has been made
2. Save partial results when stopping
3. Add ability to resume processing from where it was stopped
4. Show more detailed progress information during processing
